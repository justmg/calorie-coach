‚è∫ Perfect! I've successfully configured your n8n workflows for the calorie coach application.
  Here's what was created:

  üîß Created Workflows

  1. ElevenLabs Webhook Handler (ID: QzqCIppqNGxEVJUB)
  - Receives webhook callbacks from ElevenLabs after calls complete
  - Parses transcript data to extract calorie information
  - Saves calorie entries to Supabase
  - Updates call log status

  2. Daily Call Scheduler (ID: f99ATHtNBISB8lM2)
  - Runs daily at 8 AM using cron trigger
  - Fetches all active users from database
  - Checks each user's call window preferences
  - Initiates ElevenLabs calls for users within their window
  - Creates call log records

  3. User Registration Handler (ID: 7NcrGAP8wtVCBZvS)
  - Webhook endpoint for new user registrations from your app
  - Validates user data (Clerk ID, phone, PIN format)
  - Creates new users or updates existing ones
  - Returns formatted response

  4. Error Handler and Notifications (ID: 8YGv9IComIjqeIx6)
  - Central error logging webhook
  - Saves all errors to the errors table
  - Sends admin email notifications for critical errors
  - Provides structured error response

  üöÄ Next Steps

  To activate these workflows:

  1. Set up credentials in n8n for:
    - Supabase (URL, service key)
    - ElevenLabs API key
    - Email sender credentials
  2. Activate the workflows using:
  // Update workflow to active status
  mcp__n8n-mcp__n8n_update_full_workflow({
    id: "workflow_id_here",
    active: true
  })

  3. Configure webhook URLs in your application to point to these n8n endpoints
  4. Test each workflow with sample data to ensure proper functionality

  The workflows are now ready and will handle the complete flow from user registration through
  daily call scheduling and calorie data processing!
